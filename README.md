# ethar-universal
Universal phonemic shorthand script 
#handwritten #alphabet

A set of 56 glyphs in a script that cover phoneme groupings for all Human speech. An international auxillary script. Less detailed & accurate than IPA, but thus easier to learn. Designed for shorthand purposes but intended to be compatible to write any language. 

Started in 02016 by Canadian RA Ball, the primary development phase until 08-02019 = version 1.0.

The glyphs and the phonetics of the system are open (CC 4.0-BY-SA, until I understand open source well enough to choose a better license). You are welcome to use it for language projects, education, etc.

I will maintain the core rules here, but welcome involvement to ensure that it can be adapted for use in your native tongue. Tonal and high-consonant count languages need user testing the most.
Details for rules, glyphs, et cet to follow in tandem with official release.
